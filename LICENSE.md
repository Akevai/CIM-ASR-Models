ꞌĀkonoꞌanga License (A Māori ꞋAvaiki Localisation of the Kaitiaki License: Kaitiakitanga; Rōpū Māori Data Sovereignty Licence 1.1) 

Preamble

ꞌĀkonoꞌanga (Māori ꞌAvaiki) is the practice of caring for something. In this context we protect the code in this repository and will provide access to the code as per our peu Māori (Māori customs and protocols).

While we recognize the importance of open source technology, we're mindful that the majority of tangata whenua and other Indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from open source technologies. As tangata moana, our ability to grow, develop, and innovate has been stymied through colonisation. We must protect our ability to grow as Indigenous people. By simply open sourcing our data and knowledge, we further allow ourselves to be colonised digitally in the modern world.
