The file `cim-asr-lrec.ipynb` loads a language model trained using [XLSR-Wav2Vec2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/xlsr_wav2vec2) and uses it to transcribe recordings in Cook Islands MƒÅori. It was trained using 4 hours of transcribed recordings from the [Paradisec CIM collection](https://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/SN1). The code is based on [Fine-tuning XLS-R for Multi-Lingual ASR with ü§ó Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-xlsr-wav2vec2) by [Patrick von Platen](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten).

The CIM model is licensed under the Kaitiakitanga license (https://github.com/TeHikuMedia/Kaitiakitanga-License), created by [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/). Please read the file `license.md` for more details. You can use the model for non-profit purposes, but you must contact the authors to reuse it. Unless you are a member of the Cook Islands MƒÅori community, please do not attempt to the data from the model.
